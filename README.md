# DynamicDataReplica

## Overview

The `DynamicDataReplica` library provides a dynamic way to replicate and manipulate objects in .NET.

It allows for deep and shallow cloning of objects, dynamic property access, and custom value modification through the `IValueModifier` interface. Additionally, it includes a custom JSON converter for seamless serialization and deserialization of `DynamicDataReplica` objects.
